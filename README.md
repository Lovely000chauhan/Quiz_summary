#Project Title:# Quiz Performance Analysis and Recommendations
Overview : This project analyzes quiz performance data to provide insights and personalized recommendations. It uses machine learning models for regression (to predict scores) and classification (to detect weak topics). The goal is to help students improve their preparation for competitive exams by identifying strengths and weaknesses in various topics.
Setup Instructions: 1. Clone the Repository
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
3. Install Dependencies
4.Run the Project
5. Sample Data
Approach:
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Converted quiz dates to `datetime` and calculated days since the first quiz.
   - Standardized features to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.

2. Clustering:
   - Used KMeans clustering to group performance into three clusters: "Consistently Strong," "Average Performer," and "Needs Improvement."

3. Regression Model:
   - Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict quiz scores.

4. Classification Model:
   - Trained a Logistic Regression classifier to detect weak topics based on accuracy (<50%).

5. User Input:
   - Collected real-time input to predict weak topics and provide actionable recommendations.

6. Recommendations:
   - Highlighted strengths and weaknesses for personalized improvement plans.

Here’s a guide to help you organize your project and prepare your GitHub repository for submission. Follow these steps to ensure your submission meets the requirements:

1. Organizing the Repository
Structure your GitHub repository as follows:

bash
Copy
Edit
quiz-performance-analysis/
│
├── README.md              # Project overview, setup instructions, and approach
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── data/
│   └── sample_data.csv    # Sample dataset (optional, anonymized if needed)
├── models/
│   ├── classifier.pkl     # Saved classification model
│   ├── regressor.pkl      # Saved regression model
├── src/
│   ├── main.py            # Main script (contains the logic you shared)
│   ├── utils.py           # Helper functions (optional, for modular code)
│   └── preprocessing.py   # Data preprocessing logic (optional)
└── .gitignore             # Ignore unnecessary files (e.g., .pkl files, virtual environments)
2. Writing the README
Create a README.md file with the following sections:
